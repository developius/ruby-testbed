# ruby-testbed

This is my ruby testbed for projects and playing around with Ruby on Rails. Lots of the code will likely being testing things out and will therefore be unstable and buggy :D

I've built everything using Ruby 2.3.3, all you need to do to run the code is execute `bundle install && rails server`
